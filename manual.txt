Mini Manual:

This is a program used to solve a Tourism problem. 

In the context of the Tourism, the travellers need to plan a travel schdule that allow them to finish travelling all of the planned attractions in the fewist day but getting a highest score. A score is given to each attraction. We can understand these scores as a ranking of how interesting these attractions are. 

In order to do this, the traveller needs to input two lines of data into the program to get what they want. 

The first line contains two integers. N is an integer that represents the number of attractions planned by the traveller. K is the other integer that represents the maximum number of attractions the traveller allows themselves to go. 

The second line contains N different attractions representing by their scores. The order of the attractions matters. Each attraction score are seperated by a space. No other space or characters allowed when inputting. 

There are also other restrictions on the value of N and k:

1:1<=K<=N<=10^6
2:K<=100
3:N<=10^5

One extra restriction on the N integers (second line input):
we denote the N integers as a1, a2, a3, ......, aN

1<ai<10^9

Example input:
line one:5 3
line two:5 2 1 7 4

The output will be the maximum score you can get from the best arrangement that the program finds.
